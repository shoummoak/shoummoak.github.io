## About

Hello, I am Shoummo (pronounced show-mo), a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Indiana University. I am advised by Sa√∫l Blanco.

The research direction that I am currently interested in is the intersection of machine learning and discrete optimiztion problems. Particularly, developing principled machine learning methods to effectively solve discrete problems that are typically NP-Hard in nature. I am also interested in the application of such methods in real-world problems commonly found in fields such as Biology and Operations Research.
