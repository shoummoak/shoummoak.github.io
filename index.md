## About

Hello, I am Shoummo (pronounced Show-Mo), a Computer Science PhD student at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am advised by <a href="https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/sblancor/" target="_blank">Sa√∫l Blanco</a>.

I am currently interested in the intersection of machine learning and discrete optimiztion problems. Particularly, developing principled machine learning methods to solve discrete problems that are typically NP-Hard in nature. I am also interested in the application of such methods to real-world problems commonly found in fields such as Biology and Operations Research.
