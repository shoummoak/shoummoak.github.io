## About

Hello, I am Shoummo, a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Indiana University -- Bloomington. I am advised by Sa√∫l Blanco.

My research interests are in the intersection of machine learning and discrete optimiztion problems. Particularly, developing principled machine learning methods to optimally and/or efficiently solve discrete problems that are typically NP-Hard in nature. I am also interested in the application of such methods in real-world problems arising in fields such as Biology and Operations Research.
